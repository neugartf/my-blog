## Meat in Spain

Meat has always had a important role in the Spanish cuisine, as it has in many other European dishes. Most people will know of the famous [jamón ibérico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam%C3%B3n_ib%C3%A9rico) or the [chorizo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo). So  it comes to no surprise that it also ranks in the top 10 countries with the most meat consumption per capita. It also produces vast amount of pork, of which it exports a large portion of it.
